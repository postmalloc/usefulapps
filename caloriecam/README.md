# CalorieCam

Single-file web app that estimates meal calories from a photo using AI vision and keeps a local food log in your browser.

## What it does
- Photo capture + preview
- AI breakdown with editable items and macro totals
- Local log with search, import/export, and charts
- Optional manual entry mode

## Run
- Open `index.html` in a browser.

## Setup
- Add your API key in Settings, or point to a proxy URL.
- Pick a vision-capable model and run a test connection.

## Notes
- Logs are stored locally in your browser (no server).
- Using a direct API key in the browser exposes it on that device; a small proxy is safer.
